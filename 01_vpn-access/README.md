# Getting access to the Charite VPN

1. **Fill in both VPN forms, 'vpn_antrag', and 'vpn_zusatzantrag_b'**  
Print and sign both of these, scan them in and attach both files to an e-mail *sent from your charite e-mail address* to vpn@charite.de, with a subject line like 'surname, firstname, VPN access' Please also cc Chiara (chiara.romagnani@charite.de) so that they know you have permission.

2. **Install OpenVPN and configure your connection**
Refer to either installation on macOS ('vpn_macOS_installation') or Windows ('vpn_Windows_installation')

3. **Test your connection to the vpn**  
Connect through the VPN (the 'save password' function is handy) and make sure you are connect by going to http://vpntest.charite.de. If there is no proxy connection, this should not be a problem.
