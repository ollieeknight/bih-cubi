# Introduction to the repository  
Beginning in July of 2022, the Romagnani lab will move from the DRFZ work server to the [Berlin Institute of Health-Core Bioinformatics Unit (BIH-CUBI) High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster](https://www.hpc.bihealth.org/). This allows several advantages including more storage space, faster workloads, and more flexible and shared analysis pipelines.  

During the move Ollie will help move data from the DRFZ server using ```rclone```. An alternative method will soon be found to move from from the datastore to the BIH-CUBI cluster, and *vice versa*.
