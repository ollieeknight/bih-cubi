# Introduction to the repository  
Beginning in July of 2022, the Romagnani lab will move from the DRFZ work server to the [Berlin Institute of Health-Core Bioinformatics Unit (BIH-CUBI) High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster](https://www.hpc.bihealth.org/). This allows several advantages including more storage space, faster workloads, and more flexible and shared analysis pipelines.  

During the move Ollie will help move data from the DRFZ server using ```rclone```. An alternative method will soon be found to move from from the datastore to the BIH-CUBI cluster, and *vice versa*.

Several support options are available if you run into errors (in order of what you should check first):  
1. The BIH-CUBI HPC [documents](https://bihealth.github.io/bih-cluster/)  
2. Timo and Ollie  
3. The BIH-CUBI HPC [blog](https://hpc-talk.cubi.bihealth.org/) for posting and helping with issues  
4. The HPC helpdesk (hpc-helpdesk@bih-charite.de), explaining your problem according to [these guidelines](https://bihealth.github.io/bih-cluster/help/good-tickets/)  


To do list:  
- ```rclone``` replacement for data migration and archiving  
- Etiquette for the ```ag_romagnani``` group folder  
- Guides sequencing methods (base masks etc), understanding outs
