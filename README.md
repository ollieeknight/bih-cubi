# Introduction to the repository  
The Romagnani lab is moving from the DRFZ work server to the [Berlin Institute of Health-Core Bioinformatics Unit (BIH-CUBI) High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster](https://www.hpc.bihealth.org/). This allows several advantages including more storage space, faster workloads, and more flexible and shared analysis pipelines.  

During the move Ollie will help move data from the DRFZ server using the ```rclone``` package. Move your data onto /scratch/ and he'll move it over. An alternative method will soon be found to move from from the datastore to the BIH-CUBI cluster, and *vice versa*.

Several support options are available if you run into errors (in order of what you should check first):  
1. The BIH-CUBI HPC [documents](https://bihealth.github.io/bih-cluster/)  
2. Timo and Ollie  
3. The BIH-CUBI HPC [blog](https://hpc-talk.cubi.bihealth.org/) for posting and helping with issues  
4. The HPC helpdesk (hpc-helpdesk@bih-charite.de), explaining your problem according to [these guidelines](https://bihealth.github.io/bih-cluster/help/good-tickets/)  


To do list:  
- ```rclone``` replacement for data migration and archiving  
- Etiquette for the ```ag_romagnani``` group folder  
- Guides sequencing methods (base masks etc), understanding outs
